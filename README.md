# üìö LibraAI ‚Äì Smart AI-Powered Digital Library System

## üß† Overview

In the age of digital transformation, libraries are no longer just physical spaces, but intelligent, AI-driven ecosystems. **LibraAI** is a state-of-the-art digital library management system built with **Object-Oriented Design Principles** and enhanced by **Google Cloud AI services**, offering:

- üîí Secure authentication and role-based access  
- üìñ Smart cataloging and real-time tracking  
- üîç Advanced search and personalized recommendations  
- ü§ñ AI tools: summarization, translation, read-aloud, and intelligent Q&A

## üèóÔ∏è Problem Statement

The legacy **Nexus Library System** (now evolved into **LibraAI**) faced critical issues post-upgrade:

- ‚ùå Duplicate/missing records caused availability confusion  
- üîì Uncontrolled access to restricted collections  
- üì¶ Mismatched borrow records vs availability  
- üîç Ineffective search and irrelevant suggestions  

To overcome these, our engineering team rebuilt the system using a clean, scalable architecture powered by modern **OOP design patterns** and **Google AI**.

## üß∞ OOP & Design Patterns Used

### üîÅ Creational Patterns
- **Factory Pattern**: Dynamic creation of `LibraryItem` types (E-Book, Journal, Research Paper, Audiobook, Physical Book)
- **Singleton Pattern**: Shared `LibraryDatabase` for consistent access control
- **Builder Pattern**: Configurable library items with optional metadata

### üèóÔ∏è Structural Patterns
- **Facade Pattern**: Unified interface for user operations (borrow, return, reserve)
- **Decorator Pattern**: Extend item features like priority access

### üîÑ Behavioral Patterns
- **Observer Pattern**: Real-time alerts (due dates, availability)
- **Strategy Pattern**: Swappable search logic and recommendation engine
- **Command Pattern**: Support for undo/redo borrowing actions
- **State Pattern**: Book condition/status transitions (Available ‚Üí Reserved ‚Üí Borrowed)
